# HexChat-Weather-Crypto-IMDB-Bot-AddOn
HexChat-Weather-Crypto-IMDB-Bot-AddOn - Looks up weather, crypto prices, imdb ratings via API keys in a python script for hexchat.

Sure! I will include "s0berage" as the author in the script's comment section and also include it in the printed output when the script is loaded. This helps clarify who developed the script. Below is the updated script with the author attribute included.

### Steps to Deploy
1. **Replace API Keys**: Replace `'your_openweather_api_key'` and `'your_omdb_api_key'` with your actual API keys.
2. **Save the Script**: Save the updated code in a file named `weather_crypto_imdb.py`.
3. **Load the Script in HexChat**:
   - Open HexChat.
   - Go to `Settings -> Plugin and Scripts -> Load`.
   - Select your `weather_crypto_imdb.py` file.

### Usage
- Use the following commands on HexChat to get information:
  - **Weather**: `.w cityname countryname`
  - **Cryptocurrency Price**: `.crypto coinname`
  - **IMDB Ratings**: `.imdb movie_or_show_title`

This version of the script includes the author information, versioning, and advertisement, making it user-friendly and informative. Test it in HexChat to ensure all features work as expected!
